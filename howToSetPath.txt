## For separating the Input and the Output dir

1. First, create the parent dir.
2. "Open with VS Code"
3. Create two separate folders for the source codes and the compiled files. 
4. In settings.json, (**WorkSpace, not User**) ,  

{
"java.project.outputPath": "./Output/",     (The relative path to the folder(from the parent dir) where the compiled files are to be stored)
"java.project.sourcePaths": ["./Source/"]     (The relative path to the folder(from the parent dir) where the source files are to be stored. This takes an array of paths)
}


In this way, we can have separate folders for source and compiled files. However, all these settings are folder specific i.e., for other folders we have to set again. 


####If the VS Code fails to locate the JDK, inside settings.json (User) set: 

"java.jdt.ls.java.home": "E:\\Java"

This takes the absolute path to the folder containing JDK. For details, check out the feature contribution section by opening the extension in VS Code.
